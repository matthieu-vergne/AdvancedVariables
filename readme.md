# Advanced Data Management

## What is the aim of this project

With this project, I try to centralize several libraries that I develop in order to help dealing with data in general. Please refer to the specific modules *data-Xxx* to read their own description.

## How to use it?

It is managed through Maven and is available on the [central repository](http://search.maven.org/). However this project is not a library by its own, but a set of libraries. Please refer to the description of each *data-Xxx* module for more details. The *data-samples* module is a special case, as it is aimed to be read directly, not to be used (although you can try and run its classes).
